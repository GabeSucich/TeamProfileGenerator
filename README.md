# TeamProfileGenerator

This application utilizes the npm inquirer package wrapped within an async-await function to create a command-line interface to produce a basic team profile generator. Users are prompted with questions about team members, with prompts changing based on previous responses. The object-oriented program uses basic ES6 classes to store responses from the user. This information is then added to an HTML template which is written to an HTML file.

This task was an introduction to object-oriented programming, class inheritance, and the structure of testing using jest.
